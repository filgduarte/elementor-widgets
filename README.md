### Just a few useful Elementor widgets

This plugin has Elementor widgets that I made to use in some of my projects.

Widgets included:

- **Before/After Slider**: Shows two images that are revealed as a vertical divider is slid left or right.
- **Custom Search Form\***: The basic Elementor search form, but you can choose a custom icon.
- **Masked Element**: Shows a color, image, gradient or video masked by an image shape or luminance.
